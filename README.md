# diffusion-model-microscopy-images
This project involves using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate synthetic microscopy images. The goal is to create high-quality synthetic images that can be used for training and testing image analysis algorithms, such as cell segmentation or classification.
